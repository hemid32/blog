            <p class="card-text">Four or five years ago I owned an ancient site called "Researcher of Wisdom." And I had to close it to study. Since I closed it and the idea of ​​creating a new website haunted me, and today my free time met with mood with the idea to bring this blog to light. Most of the topics on this blog, which I will add to it in the future, are common topics and interests between me and a lot of friends who we no longer meet like we were during the period of study. And I hope for this that this site will be a link between us and a continuation of our discussions and a place to share what we have come to us or to deliver on our trip after graduation. I also hope that this blog brings me together with wonderful people who share my various interests, or at least some of them, whether this participation in the interest in building a wonderful career or a love for learning or a pursuit of continuous improvement and self-development or even a desire to learn writing or discussing topics that I will write from time Another, which will be varied and include many things from philosophy, logic, psychology, and some of my personal opinions, my daily attitudes, and my thinking out loud about them again. Finally, I hope that this blog will be useful to everyone who reads these words of mine, as much as I will benefit from them and from working on them. And if anyone has comments, suggestions, or corrections for any error in the lack of the blog or its topics, I will be more than happy to receive this and respond to it in the comments, my dear.
